# Foodfy Administration

In this challenge I created an administrative area for Foodfy.

## Project changes

- Added an administrative area where you can add, edit and delete recipes.
- The routes have been separated from the server, and are now controlled by `routes.js`.
- The administrative area and website consume the same data, now located at `data.json`.
