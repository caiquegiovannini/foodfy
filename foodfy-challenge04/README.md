# Foodfy Database

In this challenge I created a database for Foodfy.

## Project changes

- Data previously saved to a JSON file is now stored in a PostgreSQL database.
- Added new registration, listing, and editing chef pages, each recipe is assigned to a chef.
- Added a recipe search field where you can filter recipes by their name.

## [Admin] Chefs registration

New administrative page that will be able to do the registration, listing, updating and removal of chefs.

## [Website] Recipe search

To facilitate the search for a registered recipe, the person who accesses the website can filter by name of the recipe.

## [Website] Chefs listing
