# Refactoring Foodfy

In this challenge, I refactored the Foodfy website by using Express and Nunjucks.
The back-end has been separated from the front-end making data disply more dynamic.

## Project changes

- The recipe data is now contained in the file `data.js`.
- By clicking on a recipe the user will now be redirected to a new page containing all the recipe information such as ingredients, preparation mode and additional information.
